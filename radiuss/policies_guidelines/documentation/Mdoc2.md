**M.doc.2** RADIUSS product documentation source must be revision-controlled along with source code.

> Rationale: The documentation should be version controlled along with source code so that developers and users can easily retrieve the documentation associated with any revision of the code. Versioning documentation with source code also allows any developer to easily contribute to the documentation. (WSC 4.3)
