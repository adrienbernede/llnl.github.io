**R.bui.3** RADIUSS products coded in C++ and/or FORTRAN should be built using CMake and BLT (Build, Link and Test).

> Rationale: Consistent use of CMake and BLT will enable individual users, computing centers, and package managers (such as Spack) to install the package in a way that is compatible with other RADIUSS products on the same system.
