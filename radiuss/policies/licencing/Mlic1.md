**M4.1**  New RADIUSS products must use an OSI-approved, permissive open-source license (e.g., Apache, MIT, or BSD 3-Clause).  Similarly, any required dependencies must use an OSI-approved license that is considered compatible with the open-source permissive license for distribution purposes. Non-critical optional dependencies may use any OSI-approved license.

> Rationale: A permissive open-source license is friendlier to use by commercial entities. Note that strong copyleft licenses (e.g., GPL) are not considered compatible with permissive licenses. Weaker copyleft licenses (e.g., LGPL or GPL v2 with runtime exception) can be considered compatible for distribution purposes.
