## Version Control

**M.ver.1** All RADIUSS products must be version-controlled. In particular, using Git is considered mandatory for convenience concerns.

> Rationale: Version control is essential for collaborative development and change tracking. Git is the most popular version control system by a wide margin and sophisticated many web-based collaboration tools are available for it.

**M.ver.2** Each RADIUSS product must provide a transparent, online contribution process based on pull requests and issues collection. The preferred way to do so is using GitHub.

> Rationale: GitHub is one of the most-used repositories of open source software that includes collaboration tools such as issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis. Pull requests allow project maintainers to review changes, comment, and iterate with developers before new features are committed to a code base. Pull requests and branching simplify management of large numbers of contributions (particularly contributions across teams) and they enable many features to be developed concurrently. The product maintainer can review code and associated test results before merging it into a public branch. Pull requests can also be linked to GitHub issues, which can be created by anyone.
