## Documentation

**M.doc.1** RADIUSS products must publish documentation in a web-based form.

> Rationale: Web-based documentation is accessible, searchable, and linkable. It allows users to easily point each other to relevant parts of the documentation in emails, in the code, and in other documents. 

Ref: WSC 4.1

---

**M.doc.2** RADIUSS product documentation source must be version controlled and kept coherent with source code.

> Rationale: When documentation is version controlled coherently with source code, developers and users can easily retrieve the documentation associated with any revision of the code. Versioning documentation along with source code (in the same repository) also allows any developer to easily contribute to the documentation. 

Ref: WSC 4.3

**M.doc.3** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team, even for RADIUSS itself.

Ref: xSDK M5

---

**R.doc.4** Web and pdf documentation should be produced from a reabable plain-text format. Suggested examples are Sphinx, LaTeX, or Doxygen.

> Rationale: All of these tools allow to create web-based manuals and API documentation automatically, using a familiar, non-HTML plain-text format.
