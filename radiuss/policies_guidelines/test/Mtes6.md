**R.tes.6** Products should enforce code quality/health with static checkers and/or other tools.

> Rationale: Code quality checkers help to prevent code constructs that may result in errors in future environments where the code may run. They also reduce noise in build output that may obfuscate real errors. Code style checkers can also help enforce consistent style across a project.
