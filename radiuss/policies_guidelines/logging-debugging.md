# Logging and Debugging

**R.log.1**  Consistent, formated logs is a recommended practice. RADIUSS products may use SLIC to achieve this.

> Rationale: Consistency and ease of maintenance, etc.

**R.log.2**  RADIUSS products should provide at least two types of builds: debug and production.

> Rationale: Production version should not be compiled with debug symbols, a mechanism to enable/disable those at compile time should be provided.
