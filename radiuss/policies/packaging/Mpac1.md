**M.pac.1** Each RADIUSS product API must include a way to return the current version number of the software and indicate which configure/CMAKE and compiler options were used to build the package. For development versions of the software, each package must provide the current commit ID in the repository.

> Rationale: This allows users to make an inventory of what they have, which can aid debugging and configuration management.
