**M.ver.2** Each RADIUSS product must be maintained at GitHub.

> Rationale: GitHub is one of the most-used repositories of open source software that includes collaboration tools such as issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis. Pull requests allow project maintainers to review changes, comment, and iterate with developers before new features are committed to a code base. Pull requests and branching simplify management of large numbers of contributions (particularly contributions across teams) and they enable many features to be developed concurrently.
